    "# Scaling Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimisation using RayTune\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will explore various Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimisation algorithms and evaluate their distributed schedulers for fast, efficient scaling. The task at hand is Neural Architecture Search (NAS), and the following auxiliary frameworks will be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ax**: Abstraction on top of the popular BoTorch library\n",
    "2. **Optuna**: Uses tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) for Bayesian optimisation\n",
    "\n",
    "**RayTune** is the scalable optimisation framework that acts as a distributed backbone for these auxiliary algorithms, and helps scale them in distributed environments. The notebook compares their performance on NAS tasks of varying performances, and in particular, probes their scheduling algorithms that control execution and search speed."
